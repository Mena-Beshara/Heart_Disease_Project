# Comprehensive Machine Learning Full Pipeline on Heart Disease UCI Dataset

** This project aims to analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks using machine 
learning. The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality 
reduction (PCA), model training, evaluation, and deployment. Classification models like 
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM will be used, alongside 
K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for unsupervised learning. ** 

## Objectives: 
● Perform Data Preprocessing & Cleaning (handle missing values, encoding, scaling). 
● Apply Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) to retain essential features. 
● Implement Feature Selection using statistical methods and ML-based techniques. 
● Train Supervised Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random 
Forest, SVM) for classification. 
● Apply Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) for pattern discovery. 
● Optimize Models using Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV, 
RandomizedSearchCV). 


## Tools to be Used: 
● Programming Languages: Python 
● Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras 
(optional) 
● Dimensionality Reduction & Feature Selection: PCA, RFE, Chi-Square Test 
● Supervised Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM 
● Unsupervised Models: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
